    1.Make sure you have to most up to date version of Atom

You can update atom by going to 

window:

     2. Make sure you are not using Vpn or using a proxcy
some of the packages will not able to install when they can't verify your identity and your signing ceritificate . Make sure you switch off your vpn while you are try to install it.
